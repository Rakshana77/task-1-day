DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP1.1 AND HTTP 2:
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication.
HTTP user sends the request to the server and the server sends the response to the user.
In this blog, we'll learn the key differences between these two protocols
explore how HTTP/2 has addressed the shortcomings of its predecessor.
HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.
HTTP 1.1:
HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form.
* The head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not receive.
* all the information related to the header file is repeated in every request.
HTTP 2:
* HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format.
* IT works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests.
* HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header.
* It compresses the header.
* The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame
?Multiplexing:
    HTTP/2 introduces multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection.
This significantly improves efficiency by reducing the number of connections required,
thereby minimizing latency and enhancing overall performance.

?Header Compression:
    In HTTP/1.1, headers were sent with each request and response, which resulted in redundant data transmission.
HTTP/2 solves this problem with header compression, which reduces the size of headers through the use of Huffman coding.

?Server Push:
     HTTP/2 supports server push, allowing the server to send multiple responses to a single request.

?Binary Protocol:
     HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol instead of plain text, making it more efficient to parse and reducing data size.

?Flow Control:
     HTTP/2 includes flow control mechanisms to manage data transmission between the client and server, preventing overwhelming one side with data.

?Priority
     HTTP/2 allows for the prioritization of requests, ensuring that more important resources are fetched first.
conclusion
     here we understand the difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2.HTTP 2 several problems that the creators of HTTP 1.1 did not anticipate.
in particular HTTP 2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP1.1.



Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript

Objects are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, serving as the building blocks for complex data structures.
They allow developers to represent real-world entities, abstract data structures, and more. In this blog, we will see the objects,
understanding how they are structured and internally represented in JavaScript.

Understanding Objects in JavaScript
      In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs,
      where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be of any data type.
      Objects are used to model entities with properties and behaviors.
      They can represent anything from a user profile to a car, and even more complex data structures like linked lists and graphs.

Internal Representation of Objects
    Internally, JavaScript objects are represented using various data structures.
    While these details are abstracted away from developers,
    understanding the general concepts can help you write more efficient code.

Properties and Values:
    Each property of an object is stored as a key-value pair.
    The property name (key) is stored as a string, and the associated value can be of any type.
    These pairs are stored in a manner that allows quick access based on the property name.

Property Descriptor:
        For each property, JavaScript maintains a property descriptor.
     This descriptor contains information about the property, such as whether it's writable, enumerable, and configurable.
     This descriptor influences how properties can be accessed and modified.

Prototype Chain:
    Objects in JavaScript can have a prototype, which is another object.
    If a property is not found on an object, JavaScript looks for it in the prototype object,
    creating a chain that continues until the property is found or the prototype chain ends.

Hidden Classes and Inline Caching:
    JavaScript engines often use hidden classes to optimize object property access.
    When properties are added to an object in a specific order, the engine creates a hidden class for that order.
    This optimization speeds up property access by utilizing inline caching, reducing the lookup time.

Working with Objects
Manipulating objects in JavaScript involves various operations:

Accessing Properties:
      You can access properties using dot notation (object.property) or
bracket notation (object['property']).

Adding and Modifying Properties:
      Properties can be added or modified by simply assigning values to them.

Deleting Properties:
      The delete keyword removes a property from an object.

Looping through Properties:
     The for...in loop can be used to iterate through all enumerable properties of an object.

Looping through Properties:
     The for...in loop can be used to iterate through all enumerable properties of an object.

Conclusion
     Objects are allowing developers to model and manipulate data effectively.
     Their internal representation involves property descriptors, prototype chains, and optimizations for property access.
     Understanding these concepts can empower you to write more efficient and maintainable code.
     Whether you're creating a simple data structure or implementing advanced algorithms, the objects is essential for success in JavaScript development.
